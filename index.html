          <p>When we think about Tech Industry, names like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak or Mark Suckerberg came to our minds. What have they in common? They are men. Nowadays, women are a minority in the technological industry. Many times their contribution is scorned or ignored, but it wasn't always like this, women are in Computer Science from the beggining. </p>

          <p>We should remember that was Ada Lovelace who wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, becomming the first programmer. Like her, many other women played a prominent role in the history of the CS. I can name, for example, Betty Snyder Holberton, Jean Jennings Bartik, Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum and Frances Bilas Spence who programmed ENIAC during the WWII.</p>

          <p>Margaret Hamilton is another example of the decisive role of women in technology. She was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program, which lead humans to the Moon in 1969. As a result of her work, she received NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award. If that’s not enough, she is also credited with coining the term “software engineering.”</p>

            <ul class="timeline-content">
              <li>1936 – She born in Paoli, Indiana, in the USA.</li>
              <li>1954 – She graduated from Hancock High School.</li>
              <li>1955 – Started out in mathematics at the University of Michigan.</li>
              <li>1958 – Earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham Colege.<br>She married James Cox Hamilton.<br>She also briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard.</li>
              <li>1959 – She moved to Boston, Massachusetts to do a graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University.</li>
              <li>1960 – She took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather.<br>She had a daughter called Lauren.</li>
              <li>1961 to 1963 – She worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search Soviet aircraft.</li>
              <li>1964 – Margaret joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab.</li>
              <li>July 16 to July 24, 1969 Apollo 11 mission. In a critical moment of the mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. The software designed by Margaret's team was so succesful recognizing this problem and taking recovery action that Margaret was nominated for a NASA Space Act Award.</li>
              <li>1976 to 1984 – Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software.</li>
              <li>1985 – She became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc.</li>
              <li>1986 – She received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association for Women in Computing.</li>
              <li>2003 – She was given the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award for scientific and technical contributions.</li>
              <li>2009 – Margaret received the Outstanding Alumni Award by Earlham College.</li>
              <li>2016 – She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, the highest civilian honor in the United States.</li>
              <li>April 28, 2017 – Margaret Hamilton received the Computer History Museum Fellow Award that honors exceptional men and women whose ideas have changed the world.</li>

          <h4>For Hamilton, although Apollo 11 was monumental, she relished the challenge of doing her job for it.</h4>
          <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border" aria-hidden="true"></i>From my own perspective, the software experience itself (designing it, developing it, evolving it, watching it perform and learning from it for future systems) was at least as exciting as the events surrounding the mission.</p>
